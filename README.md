‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites
You will need the following information and resources:

A Linux VPS: Running Ubuntu, Debian, or CentOS.

SSH Access: To connect to your server.

Telegram API Credentials: API ID and API Hash (from my.telegram.org).

BotFather Token: For the remote control bot.

Gemini API Key: Required for all AI features (.ai and .img).

üõ†Ô∏è Deployment Steps (Linux VPS)
Step 1: Prepare the VPS Environment
Log in via SSH and install the necessary system packages.

# Update package list and install Python 3, pip, and git
$ sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3 python3-pip git -y

Step 2: Set Up Project Structure and Virtual Environment
Always use a virtual environment (venv) for dependency isolation.

# Install venv, create directory, and activate venv
$sudo apt install python3-venv -y$ mkdir ignitos_bot && cd ignitos_bot
$python3 -m venv venv$ source venv/bin/activate

Step 3: Clone Code and Install Dependencies
Transfer your source code and install the required Python libraries.

# Clone your repository (REPLACE with your actual GitHub URL)
$ git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL] .

# Install all required Python libraries. Ensure (venv) is active!
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 4: Run for Initial Configuration
The bot needs to run interactively once to complete the initial setup and save credentials.

# Run the script and follow the on-screen prompts for all API keys and Telegram login
$ python3 main.py

Step 5: Run the Bot Continuously (24/7)
Use the screen utility to keep the bot running after disconnecting from SSH.

# Install screen (if needed)
$ sudo apt install screen -y

# Start a new screen session and launch the bot
$screen -S ignitos_session$ python3 main.py

To Detach: Press Ctrl + A then D. You can now safely log out.
